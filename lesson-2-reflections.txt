What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When I initialize a repository a secret .git file is generated which is used to track the history of the files present in that directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is an invisible place to add your files before you finally commit to the repository. Working directory is the directory
which you have created and want to work with it whereas staging area in an invisible area for adding files befor commiting to repository.
