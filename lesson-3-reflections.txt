When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

We can use remote repository to share the project with others as well for keeping a safe copy of the file in the github server.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because in that way I can choose when to fetch the new commits committed by
others. And because sometimes we are not sure that we really want to pull.
