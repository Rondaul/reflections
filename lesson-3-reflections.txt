When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

We can use remote repository to share the project with others as well for keeping a safe copy of the file in the github server.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because in that way I can choose when to fetch the new commits committed by
others. And because sometimes we are not sure that we really want to pull.

Describe the diffrences between forks,clones, and branches. When would 
you use one instead of another?

Forks are the repository that you clone from other github account in github
while clone are the copy of github repository on your local machine. Branches
are labelled commit pointer that points to the history of commits that was
committed in that branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It is beneficial as you can know what are the changes have been done since the
last commit that is fetch from the github.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what 
would be harder?

Without using Git or GitHub, we have to use emails to send the full code and use social
networking platforms like facebook, whatapp etc to send the full code with the edits and 
 changes. Git would make it much easier to collaborate.
